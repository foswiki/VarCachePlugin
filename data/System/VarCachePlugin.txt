---+ Variable Cache Plugin 

This Plugin caches Foswiki macros in selected topics for faster page rendering.

Most topics in a typical Foswiki installation are rendered within a small deviation in terms of speed. Exceptions are topics that contain a lot of dynamic content. This is mainly caused by CPU or I/O intensive [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][Macros]], such as =%<nop>SEARCH{}%= and =%<nop>INCLUDE{}%=. 

This Plugin caches all =%<nop>VARIABLES%= located in a topic so that the topic can get rendered as quickly as one without variables. An outdated cache gets refreshed when a user is looking at a topic; in which case it will take longer to render the page. Time-based refresh can also be disabled in favor of an on-demand cache update.

The rendering of Foswiki topic markup to HTML is not cached. That is, user specific HTML rendering based on skin settings is not affected by the caching.

---++ Syntax Rules and Cache Update Rules

	* Add a =%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= variable to the topic you want to cache
		* It supports these parameters:
		  | *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
		  | =refresh="24"= | Cache refresh period in hours, e.g. maximum age of cache | =REFRESH= Plugin setting |
		  | =cachemsg="..."= | Message shown when looking at a cached topic %BR% __Note:__ Use =$age= to indicate the age of cache, =$link= to indicate the refresh URL | =CACHEMSG= Plugin setting |
		  | =updatemsg="..."= | Message shown after a cache refresh %BR% __Note:__ Use =$link= to indicate the refresh URL | =UPDATEMSG= Plugin setting |
	* The =%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= variable gets:
		* replaced with the =cachemsg= message when looking at a cached topic
		* replaced with the =updatemsg= message if the cache has just been updated
		* removed if caching is not active, e.g. when the topic gets rendered dynamically
	* The cache gets updated on topic view if:
		* the cache does not exist (e.g. after adding the =%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= variable)
		* the cache is older then the cache refresh period (unless refresh if set to 0)
		* the cache is older then the topic (e.g. the topic has been updated)
		* the topic is accessed with a =?varcache=refresh= URL parameter (usually by following the <u>refresh</u> link in the cache message)
	* The topic is rendered dynamically without caching when:
		* the topic has URL parameters other then =varcache= (e.g. to show dynamic content properly, such as table sorting, filtering, searching)
		* the topic is previewed after editing
	* Limitations:
		* The cache is not user specific. For example, all users see the expanded =%<nop>WIKIUSERNAME%= of the person who refreshed the cache (on demand or by looking at a topic with an exired cache)

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences values. You can override the defaults for these preferences in %LOCALSITEPREFS%, the <nolink>%WEBPREFSTOPIC%</nolink> topic of the current web, or in individual topics that use the plugin.  *Changing them here will have no effect!* This allows you to upgrade the plugin without having to worry about losing your settings.

	* One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
		* Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION = Cache Foswiki macros in selected topics for faster page rendering

	* Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=)
		* Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_DEBUG = 0

	* Default refresh period in hours. No automatic refresh: =0=, default: =24=
		* Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_REFRESH = 24

	* Cache help messages. Use =$age= to indicate age of cache, =$link= to indicate the refresh URL
		* Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_CACHEMSG = This topic was cached $age ago ([<nop>[$link][refresh]])
		* Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_UPDATEMSG = This topic is now cached ([<nop>[$link][refresh]])
		* #Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_CACHEMSG = <a href="$link"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/cachetopic.gif" alt="This topic was cached $age ago. Click icon to refresh." width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>
		* #Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_UPDATEMSG = <a href="$link"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/cachetopic.gif" alt="This topic is now cached. Click icon to refresh." width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>
