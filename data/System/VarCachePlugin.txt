---+ Variable Cache Plugin 

%$SHORTDESCRIPTION%

Most topics in a typical Foswiki installation are rendered within a small deviation in terms of speed. Exceptions are topics that contain a lot of dynamic content. This is mainly caused by CPU or I/O intensive [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][Macros]], such as =%<nop>SEARCH{}%= and =%<nop>INCLUDE{}%=. 

This plugin caches all =%<nop>MACROS%= located in a topic so that the topic can get rendered as quickly as one without macros. An outdated cache gets refreshed when a user is looking at a topic; in which case it will take longer to render the page. Time-based refresh can also be disabled in favor of an on-demand cache update.

The rendering of Foswiki topic markup to HTML is not cached. That is, user specific HTML rendering based on skin settings is not affected by the caching.

%X% This plugin assumes topics are stored in files on disk. As such it will work with the standard Foswiki store implementations; it will *not*, however, work any non-caching database store.

---++ Syntax Rules and Cache Update Rules

Add a =%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= variable to the topic you want to cache
%INCLUDE{"VarVARCACHE" section="detail"}%

=%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= gets:
   * replaced with the =cachemsg= message when looking at a cached topic
   * replaced with the =updatemsg= message if the cache has just been updated
   * removed if caching is not active, e.g. when the topic gets rendered dynamically
The cache gets updated on topic view if:
   * the cache does not exist (e.g. after adding the =%<nop>VARCACHE{}%= variable)
   * the cache is older then the cache refresh period (unless refresh if set to 0)
   * the cache is older then the topic (e.g. the topic has been updated)
   * the topic is accessed with a =?varcache=refresh= URL parameter (usually by following the <u>refresh</u> link in the cache message)
The topic is rendered dynamically without caching when:
   * the topic has URL parameters other then =varcache= (e.g. to show dynamic content properly, such as table sorting, filtering, searching)
   * the topic is previewed after editing
Limitations:
   * The cache is not user specific. For example, all users see the expanded =%<nop>WIKIUSERNAME%= of the person who refreshed the cache (on demand or by looking at a topic with an expired cache)

---++ Settings

Settings are stored as preferences values. You can override the defaults for these preferences in %LOCALSITEPREFS%, the <nolink>%WEBPREFSTOPIC%</nolink> topic of the current web, or in individual topics that use the plugin.

%X% *Changing them here will have no effect!*

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_SHORTDESCRIPTION = Cache Foswiki macros in selected topics for faster page rendering

   * Default refresh period in hours. No automatic refresh: =0=, default: =24=
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_REFRESH = 24

   * Cache help messages. Use =$age= to indicate age of cache, =$link= to indicate the refresh URL
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_CACHEMSG = This topic was cached $age ago ([<nop>[$link][refresh]])
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_CACHEMSG = <a href="$link"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/cachetopic.gif" alt="This topic was cached $age ago. Click icon to refresh." width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_UPDATEMSG = This topic is now cached ([<nop>[$link][refresh]])
      * Set VARCACHEPLUGIN_UPDATEMSG = <a href="$link"><img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/cachetopic.gif" alt="This topic is now cached. Click icon to refresh." width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>
